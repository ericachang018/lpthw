# Exercise 23 - Reading code on the internet! 
#

# Here's what you do:

# Go to bitbucket.org, github.com, or gitorious.org with your favorite web browser and search for "python."
# Avoid any project that mentions "Python 3". That'll only confuse you.
# Pick a random project and click on it.
# Click on the Source tab and browse through the list of files and directories until you find a .py file (but not setup.py, that's useless).
# Start at the top and read through it, to take notes on what you think it does.
# If any symbols or strange words seem to interest you, write them down to research later.
