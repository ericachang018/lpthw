# Exercise 12 : Prompting People 

# In the terminal you can get some pydocs directly by typing 
# >> pydoc raw_input (or anything else you'd like to read up on) 

age = raw_input ("How old are you?")
height = raw_input ("how tall are you?")
weight = raw_input("How much do you weight?")

print "so you are %r old, %r tall and %r heavy?" % (age, height, weight)
